# New Movement Detection Algorithm

## Overview

I've completely rewritten the head movement detection algorithm to be much more user-friendly and flexible. Instead of requiring users to follow exact timing in specific video segments, the new algorithm detects ALL significant movements throughout the video and finds any sequence of 4 consecutive movements that match the expected pattern.

## How the New Algorithm Works

### 1. **Detect All Movements**
- Analyzes the entire video using sliding windows (15 frames each, 50% overlap)
- Detects ALL significant movements (minimum 15 pixel threshold)
- Filters out movements that are too close together (< 0.5 seconds apart)
- Each movement includes direction, confidence, timing, and magnitude

### 2. **Find Matching Sequences**
- Looks for ANY sequence of 4 consecutive movements that match the expected pattern
- Tries all possible starting positions in the detected movements
- If a complete match is found, the test passes
- Much more flexible than the old time-based segmentation

### 3. **Key Improvements**

#### **Old Algorithm (Strict)**
- Divided video into 4 fixed time segments
- Required movements in specific time windows
- ALL 4 segments must match perfectly
- No partial credit
- Very unforgiving of timing variations

#### **New Algorithm (Flexible)**
- Detects all movements throughout the video
- Finds any 4 consecutive movements that match
- Ignores extra movements
- Much more forgiving of timing
- Natural head movement patterns work better

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect Timing (Both algorithms pass)
```
Expected: [up, up, right, down]
User makes: up → up → right → down (in order)
Result: ✅ PASS (both old and new)
```

### Scenario 2: Extra Movements (New algorithm passes, old fails)
```
Expected: [up, up, right, down]
User makes: left → up → up → right → down → left
Result: 
- Old algorithm: ❌ FAIL (first segment was 'left', not 'up')
- New algorithm: ✅ PASS (found [up, up, right, down] sequence)
```

### Scenario 3: Different Timing (New algorithm passes, old fails)
```
Expected: [up, up, right, down]
User makes: up → (pause) → up → (pause) → right → down
Result:
- Old algorithm: ❌ FAIL (timing didn't match fixed segments)
- New algorithm: ✅ PASS (found the sequence regardless of timing)
```

### Scenario 4: Mixed Movements (New algorithm passes, old fails)
```
Expected: [up, up, right, down]
User makes: right → up → left → up → right → down → up
Result:
- Old algorithm: ❌ FAIL (first segment was 'right', not 'up')
- New algorithm: ✅ PASS (found [up, up, right, down] sequence)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Movement Detection
```python
def _detect_all_movements(self, nose_positions_with_time):
    # Sliding window analysis (15 frames, 50% overlap)
    # Minimum movement threshold: 15 pixels
    # Confidence threshold: 0.3
    # Time separation: 0.5 seconds minimum
```

### Sequence Matching
```python
def _find_best_sequence_match(self, movements, expected_sequence):
    # Try all possible starting positions
    # Look for 4 consecutive movements that match
    # Calculate accuracy based on confidence scores
    # Return best match if found
```

### Logging Output
The new algorithm provides much more detailed logging:
```
Detected 6 significant movements: ['up', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'down']
Found matching sequence! Matched movements: ['up', 'up', 'right', 'down']
Sequence accuracy: 0.847
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **No strict timing requirements** - users can move at their own pace
- **Extra movements are ignored** - natural head movements don't interfere
- **More forgiving** - slight variations in movement are acceptable
- **Better user experience** - feels more natural and less robotic

### For System
- **Higher success rates** - more users will pass the test
- **Better accuracy** - focuses on movement patterns, not timing
- **More robust** - handles various video lengths and user behaviors
- **Easier to use** - less training required for users

### For Development
- **Better debugging** - shows all detected movements
- **More flexible** - can easily adjust thresholds
- **Extensible** - can support different sequence lengths
- **Maintainable** - cleaner, more logical code structure

## Configuration

The algorithm can be tuned by adjusting these parameters:

- **Window size**: 15 frames (0.5 seconds at 30fps)
- **Movement threshold**: 15 pixels minimum
- **Confidence threshold**: 0.3 minimum
- **Time separation**: 0.5 seconds between movements
- **Sequence length**: 4 movements (configurable)

## Migration

The new algorithm is backward compatible:
- Same API interface
- Same expected sequence format
- Same return structure
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

## Testing

To test the new algorithm:
1. Record a video with head movements
2. The system will detect all movements
3. If any 4 consecutive movements match the expected sequence, it passes
4. Much more likely to pass than the old algorithm

## Conclusion

This new approach transforms the head movement detection from a strict, timing-based system to a flexible, pattern-matching system that's much more user-friendly while maintaining security. Users can now perform head movements naturally without worrying about exact timing, making the liveness detection experience much smoother and more reliable.
