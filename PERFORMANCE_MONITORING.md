# Video Liveness Performance Monitoring

This document describes the comprehensive performance monitoring system implemented for the video liveness processing pipeline.

## Overview

The performance monitoring system tracks detailed timing information for video liveness requests to help determine if the system is performing well enough for production use.

## What Gets Tracked

### 1. Request Lifecycle Timing
- **Request Start**: When a video liveness request begins
- **Video File Reception**: Time to fully receive the uploaded video file
- **Video File Save**: Time to save the video to temporary storage
- **Video Processing Start**: When actual video processing begins
- **Video Processing Complete**: When video analysis finishes
- **Request Complete**: Total end-to-end request time

### 2. Detailed Processing Metrics
- **Video Opening Time**: Time to open and validate video file
- **Frame Processing Time**: Time spent analyzing video frames
- **Face Comparison Time**: Time for face matching (if enabled)
- **Movement Analysis Time**: Time to analyze head movement patterns
- **Anti-spoofing Analysis**: Time for liveness detection

### 3. Performance Indicators
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful requests
- **Average Response Time**: Mean time for complete requests
- **Processing Efficiency**: Ratio of processing time to total time
- **Throughput**: Requests per second the system can handle

## Performance Analysis

### Running Performance Analysis

Use the provided analysis script to evaluate system performance:

```bash
# Basic performance analysis
./check_performance.sh

# Analysis with detailed JSON output
./check_performance.sh --save

# Direct Python script usage
python3 analyze_performance.py --log-file /app/logs/facematch.log
```

### Performance Thresholds

The system evaluates performance based on these thresholds:

#### Response Time
- **Excellent**: < 3 seconds average
- **Good**: < 5 seconds average  
- **Needs Attention**: < 8 seconds average
- **Unacceptable**: > 8 seconds average

#### Success Rate
- **Excellent**: > 95%
- **Good**: > 90%
- **Needs Attention**: > 80%
- **Unacceptable**: < 80%

#### Throughput
- **Good**: > 0.2 requests/second
- **Needs Attention**: > 0.1 requests/second
- **Unacceptable**: < 0.1 requests/second

## Performance Optimization

### If Performance is Poor

1. **Check Resource Usage**
   ```bash
   # Monitor CPU and memory usage
   docker stats <container_name>
   
   # Check disk I/O
   iostat -x 1
   ```

2. **Analyze Bottlenecks**
   - High video receive time: Network bandwidth issues
   - High processing time: CPU/memory constraints
   - High frame processing time: Video resolution too high

3. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Reduce video resolution/quality
   - Increase server resources
   - Implement video preprocessing
   - Use hardware acceleration (GPU)

### Performance Tuning

1. **Video Processing**
   - Adjust frame sampling rate (currently every 2nd frame)
   - Optimize MediaPipe parameters
   - Implement parallel processing

2. **System Resources**
   - Increase CPU cores for video processing
   - Add more RAM for large video files
   - Use SSD storage for faster I/O

3. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement video compression
   - Use CDN for video uploads
   - Optimize chunked uploads

## Monitoring in Production

### Automated Monitoring

Set up automated performance checks:

```bash
# Cron job to run performance analysis daily
0 2 * * * /app/check_performance.sh --save >> /app/logs/performance_check.log 2>&1
```

### Alerting

Configure alerts for poor performance:

```bash
# Example alert script
#!/bin/bash
analysis=$(python3 analyze_performance.py --log-file /app/logs/facematch.log --output -)
avg_time=$(echo "$analysis" | grep "Avg Total Time" | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/s//')

if (( $(echo "$avg_time > 5.0" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "ALERT: Video liveness performance degraded - avg time: ${avg_time}s" | mail -s "Performance Alert" admin@example.com
fi
```

### Dashboard Integration

The performance data can be integrated with monitoring dashboards:

- **Grafana**: Create dashboards showing response times and success rates
- **Prometheus**: Export metrics for time-series analysis
- **ELK Stack**: Log analysis and alerting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Empty Performance Logs**
   - No video liveness requests processed yet
   - Check if the service is running and receiving requests

2. **High Processing Times**
   - Check CPU usage during processing
   - Verify video file sizes and formats
   - Review MediaPipe configuration

3. **Low Success Rates**
   - Check for video format compatibility
   - Verify face detection is working
   - Review error logs for specific failure reasons

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
# In server.py, change log level to DEBUG
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Conclusion

This performance monitoring system provides comprehensive insights into video liveness processing performance. Regular analysis helps ensure the system meets production requirements and identifies optimization opportunities.
