# Head Movement Detection - Answers to Your Questions

## Question 1: Can the video head movement detector be modified to not be time-based?

**Answer: YES** ✅

The video head movement detector has been successfully modified to remove all time-based constraints. Here's what was changed:

### Before (Time-Based):
- Expected movements within 2 seconds per direction
- Required 1.5 seconds to return to center
- Fixed time windows for analysis
- Users had to follow strict timing requirements

### After (Non-Time-Based):
- ✅ **No time constraints** on movement detection
- ✅ **Movements detected as they occur** - whenever the user makes them
- ✅ **Flexible timing** - users can move at their own pace
- ✅ **No pressure** to complete movements within specific time windows

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Modified `enhanced_mediapipe_detector.py`**:
   - Removed time-based movement cooldowns
   - Reduced cooldown from 0.3s to 0.1s (just to prevent duplicate detections)
   - No longer expects movements within specific time windows

2. **Modified `simple_liveness.py`**:
   - Removed time-segmented analysis (2s per direction, 1.5s return)
   - Implemented movement-based analysis instead
   - Analyzes all detected movements in the video regardless of timing

3. **New Configuration System**:
   - Created `head_movement_config.py` for easy configuration
   - No time-related parameters
   - Focus on degree-based thresholds only

## Question 2: How many degrees should the head turn to count as 1 turn?

**Answer: 15° minimum recommended** 📐

For a head facing the camera at 90° (center position), here are the degree thresholds:

### Recommended Settings:

1. **Minimum Rotation: 15°**
   - Left turn: -15° to -90° (15° minimum for detection)
   - Right turn: +15° to +90° (15° minimum for detection)
   - Up tilt: -15° to -90° (15° minimum for detection)
   - Down tilt: +15° to +90° (15° minimum for detection)

2. **Significant Rotation: 25°**
   - Movements above 25° get higher confidence scores
   - Clear head turns are more reliably detected

3. **Center Threshold: 10°**
   - Head within ±10° of center is considered "facing camera"
   - Accounts for natural head sway

### Configuration Options:

The system provides three preset configurations:

| Configuration | Min Rotation | Significant | Use Case |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Lenient** | 10° | 20° | Easy detection, smaller movements |
| **Default** | 15° | 25° | Balanced, natural movements |
| **Conservative** | 20° | 30° | Strict, clear movements |

### Why 15° is Recommended:

- **Natural Movement**: 15° represents a natural head turn that's clearly visible
- **Not Too Sensitive**: Won't trigger on small head movements or camera shake
- **Not Too Strict**: Users don't need to make exaggerated movements
- **Reliable Detection**: Provides good balance between accuracy and usability

## Technical Implementation

### Degree-Based Detection:

The system now uses actual head rotation angles (yaw/pitch) instead of pixel movements:

```python
# Calculate rotation changes in degrees
yaw_change = abs(current_pose['yaw'] - self.previous_pose['yaw'])
pitch_change = abs(current_pose['pitch'] - self.previous_pose['pitch'])

# Use the larger rotation as the primary movement
rotation_magnitude = max(yaw_change, pitch_change)

# Check if rotation exceeds minimum threshold
if rotation_magnitude >= self.min_rotation_degrees:
    # Movement detected!
```

### Direction Detection:

- **Horizontal (left/right)**: Based on yaw rotation
- **Vertical (up/down)**: Based on pitch rotation
- Uses the larger rotation to determine primary direction

## Benefits of the Changes

### 1. Better User Experience
- ✅ No time pressure on users
- ✅ Natural movement detection
- ✅ Works with different movement speeds
- ✅ More accessible for users with different abilities

### 2. Improved Accuracy
- ✅ Degree-based detection is more precise
- ✅ Consistent across different face sizes and distances
- ✅ Less affected by camera quality or lighting

### 3. More Reliable
- ✅ Based on actual head rotation angles
- ✅ Not affected by pixel-level noise
- ✅ Better handling of edge cases

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Default Settings):
```python
from enhanced_mediapipe_detector import EnhancedMediaPipeDetector

# Uses 15° minimum rotation by default
detector = EnhancedMediaPipeDetector()
result = detector.process_video("video.mp4")
```

### Custom Degree Thresholds:
```python
# Require 20° minimum for stricter detection
detector = EnhancedMediaPipeDetector(
    min_rotation_degrees=20.0,
    significant_rotation_degrees=30.0
)
```

### Lenient Settings (10° minimum):
```python
from head_movement_config import LENIENT_CONFIG

detector = EnhancedMediaPipeDetector(
    min_rotation_degrees=LENIENT_CONFIG.min_rotation_degrees,
    significant_rotation_degrees=LENIENT_CONFIG.significant_rotation_degrees
)
```

## Summary

✅ **Time-based constraints removed**: No more 2s/1.5s expectations
✅ **Degree-based detection implemented**: Uses actual head rotation angles
✅ **15° minimum recommended**: Natural head turns that are clearly visible
✅ **Configurable thresholds**: Easy to adjust for different use cases
✅ **Better user experience**: No time pressure, natural movements

The system now detects head movements as they occur, using 15° as the minimum threshold for a valid head turn, providing a much more natural and user-friendly experience.
