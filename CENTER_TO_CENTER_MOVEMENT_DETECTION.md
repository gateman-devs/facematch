# Center-to-Center Movement Detection System

## Overview

The facematch system has been updated to use a new **center-to-center movement detection** approach that removes all time-based constraints. Instead of requiring users to follow strict timing requirements, the system now detects any head movement that follows the pattern: **Center → Direction → Center**.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Removed Time-Based Constraints**

**Before:**
- Fixed 3.5 seconds per direction
- Strict timing requirements
- Penalties for timing variations
- Speed adaptation algorithms

**After:**
- No time constraints
- Flexible movement timing
- Natural movement patterns
- Center-to-center validation

### 2. **New Movement Detection Algorithm**

The system now uses `_detect_center_to_center_movements()` which:

1. **Calculates center position** from all detected face positions
2. **Identifies center-to-center patterns** where:
   - Movement starts near center
   - Moves to a direction
   - Returns to center
3. **Records any valid movement** regardless of timing
4. **Validates movement magnitude** using adaptive thresholds

### 3. **Updated Challenge Generation**

**New challenge format:**
```json
{
  "type": "head_movement",
  "instruction": "Move your head in this sequence, starting and ending at center: right → left → up → down",
  "duration": 30,
  "description": "Move your head in the exact sequence shown, starting and ending at center position",
  "movement_sequence": ["right", "left", "up", "down"],
  "direction_duration": null,
  "movement_type": "center_to_center"
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Validation Configuration**

Created `create_center_to_center_validation_config()` with:
- **No timing constraints** (`max_timing_variation = inf`)
- **No pause constraints** (`pause_tolerance = inf`)
- **No speed constraints** (`speed_adaptation_enabled = false`)
- **More lenient thresholds** for better user experience
- **Higher tolerance** for extra movements

## How It Works

### 1. **Center Detection**
```python
# Calculate center from all face positions
all_x = [pos['x'] for pos in nose_positions_with_time]
all_y = [pos['y'] for pos in nose_positions_with_time]
center_x = np.mean(all_x)
center_y = np.mean(all_y)
```

### 2. **Center Tolerance**
```python
# 5% of frame size tolerance for "center" position
center_tolerance = 0.05
center_tolerance_x = center_tolerance / frame_scale_x
center_tolerance_y = center_tolerance / frame_scale_y
```

### 3. **Pattern Detection**
The system looks for patterns where:
1. Face position is near center
2. Face moves away from center in a direction
3. Face returns to center
4. Movement magnitude exceeds minimum threshold

### 4. **Direction Detection**
```python
# Determine primary direction based on largest movement
if movement_data['abs_dx'] > movement_data['abs_dy']:
    # Horizontal movement
    if movement_data['dx_pixels'] > 0:
        direction = 'right'
    else:
        direction = 'left'
else:
    # Vertical movement
    if movement_data['dy_pixels'] > 0:
        direction = 'down'
    else:
        direction = 'up'
```

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before (Time-Based):**
- Users had to follow strict 3.5-second timing
- Penalties for natural pauses
- Stress about timing requirements
- Higher failure rates due to timing issues

### **After (Center-to-Center):**
- Users can move at their natural pace
- No timing pressure
- More intuitive movement patterns
- Higher success rates
- Better accessibility

## Technical Implementation

### **New Methods Added:**

1. **`_detect_center_to_center_movements()`**
   - Main detection algorithm
   - Finds center-to-center patterns
   - Returns list of detected movements

2. **`_is_near_center()`**
   - Checks if position is within center tolerance
   - Uses adaptive frame scaling

3. **`_find_center_to_center_pattern()`**
   - Identifies complete movement patterns
   - Validates movement magnitude
   - Calculates confidence scores

### **Updated Methods:**

1. **`_validate_movement_sequence()`**
   - Now uses center-to-center detection
   - Removed time-based validation
   - Enhanced flexibility

2. **`generate_challenge()`**
   - Removed time constraints
   - Added movement type indicator
   - Updated instructions

## Configuration

### **Center-to-Center Validation Config:**
```python
ValidationConfig(
    max_timing_variation=float('inf'),  # No timing constraints
    pause_tolerance=float('inf'),       # No pause constraints
    min_movement_duration=0.0,          # No minimum duration
    speed_adaptation_enabled=False,     # No speed constraints
    max_extra_movements=8,              # Very tolerant
    extra_movement_penalty=0.02,        # Minimal penalty
    exact_match_threshold=0.80,         # More lenient
    flexible_match_threshold=0.65,
    minimum_match_threshold=0.50,
    min_movement_confidence=0.15,       # Lower requirements
    min_average_confidence=0.35
)
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python3 test_center_to_center_movements.py
```

The test creates mock nose positions that simulate center-to-center movements and validates the detection algorithm.

## Benefits
