# Enhanced MediaPipe Face Movement Detector

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the MediaPipe-based head movement detector to address accuracy issues and enhance reliability.

## Overview

The enhanced detector addresses several key issues that were affecting video liveness (head movement detection) accuracy:

1. **Face Landmark Index Issues** - Using unreliable landmark indices
2. **Movement Threshold Calibration** - Default thresholds too sensitive/insensitive
3. **Face Detection Reliability** - Intermittent face detection failures
4. **Direction Detection Logic** - Inconsistent angle-based direction detection
5. **Sequence Matching Algorithm** - Too strict validation without timing tolerance
6. **Real-time Processing** - Performance optimization for better responsiveness

## Key Improvements

### 1. Face Landmark Index Updates

**Problem**: Some landmark indices were unreliable or non-existent in MediaPipe FaceMesh.

**Solution**: Updated to use more reliable landmark indices:

```python
self.landmarks = {
    'nose_tip': 1,      # Keep this - it's reliable
    'chin': 18,         # Use 18 instead of 175
    'left_eye': 33,     # Good
    'right_eye': 263,   # Good
    'forehead': 9       # Use 9 instead of 10
}

# Alternative: Use landmark groups for better reliability
self.face_oval = [10, 338, 297, 332, 284, 251, 389, 356, 454, 323, 361, 288, 397, 365, 379, 378, 400, 377, 152, 148, 176, 149, 150, 136, 172, 58, 132, 93, 234, 127, 162, 21, 54, 103, 67, 109]
```

**Benefits**:
- More reliable landmark detection
- Reduced false negatives due to missing landmarks
- Better face pose estimation accuracy

### 2. Automatic Threshold Calibration

**Problem**: Default movement thresholds may be too sensitive or not sensitive enough for different users and lighting conditions.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic calibration based on natural head micro-movements:

```python
def calibrate_thresholds(self, video_path: str, calibration_frames: int = 60):
    """Calibrate movement thresholds based on natural head micro-movements"""
    # Process calibration frames to collect movement data
    # Set threshold at 95th percentile of natural movements * 1.5
    self.base_movement_threshold = np.percentile(movements, 95) * 1.5
```

**Benefits**:
- Adaptive thresholds for different users
- Better handling of varying lighting conditions
- Reduced false positives from natural micro-movements

### 3. Face Detection Validation

**Problem**: Face detection may fail intermittently, leading to missed movements.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive face detection validation:

```python
def _validate_face_detection(self, landmarks, image_shape) -> bool:
    """Validate that face detection is reliable"""
    # Check minimum number of landmarks (should have 468)
    # Validate key landmarks are within frame bounds
    # Check face size is reasonable (eye distance validation)
    # Ensure landmarks are properly positioned
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced false detections from poor face tracking
- Better handling of partial face visibility
- Improved reliability in challenging conditions

### 4. Improved Direction Detection

**Problem**: Angle-based direction detection was inconsistent and prone to noise.

**Solution**: Implemented dominant axis approach with hysteresis:

```python
def _detect_direction_improved(self, dx: float, dy: float, magnitude: float) -> str:
    """Improved direction detection with better angle handling"""
    # Use dominant axis approach for clearer directions
    # Require minimum movement ratio to avoid noise
    # Handle mixed movements with proper angle calculation
```

**Key Features**:
- **Dominant Axis Detection**: Prioritizes the stronger movement direction
- **Noise Filtering**: Requires minimum ratio between axes to avoid noise
- **Mixed Movement Handling**: Uses angle-based detection for diagonal movements
- **Hysteresis**: Prevents rapid direction flipping

### 5. Fuzzy Sequence Matching

**Problem**: Current validation was too strict and didn't handle timing variations.

**Solution**: Implemented fuzzy sequence matching with Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):

```python
def validate_sequence_improved(self, expected_sequence: List[str], tolerance: float = 0.3):
    """Improved sequence validation with timing tolerance and partial matching"""
    # Use dynamic programming for best subsequence match
    # Calculate timing-based accuracy
    # Combined score with configurable weights
```

**Features**:
- **LCS Algorithm**: Finds the longest common subsequence between expected and detected
- **Timing Tolerance**: Accounts for variations in movement timing
- **Partial Matching**: Handles cases where not all movements are detected
- **Configurable Weights**: Balance between sequence accuracy and timing

### 6. Real-time Processing Optimization

**Problem**: Processing was too slow for real-time feedback.

**Solution**: Added optimized video processing with frame skipping and resizing:

```python
def process_video_optimized(self, video_path: str, target_fps: int = 10):
    """Optimized video processing with frame skipping"""
    # Calculate frame skip based on target FPS
    # Resize frames for faster processing
    # Skip frames to maintain target processing rate
```

**Optimizations**:
- **Frame Skipping**: Process only necessary frames to maintain target FPS
- **Frame Resizing**: Resize large frames to 640px width for faster processing
- **Adaptive Processing**: Adjust processing based on video properties

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with Calibration

```python
from facematch.simple_mediapipe_detector import SimpleMediaPipeDetector

# Create detector
detector = SimpleMediaPipeDetector(
    min_detection_confidence=0.5,
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5,
    movement_threshold=0.02,
    debug_mode=True
)

# Calibrate thresholds using a sample video
detector.calibrate_thresholds("calibration_video.mp4", calibration_frames=60)

# Process video with optimized method
result = detector.process_video_optimized("test_video.mp4", target_fps=10)

# Validate sequence with improved matching
expected_sequence = ["left", "right", "up", "down"]
validation = detector.validate_sequence_improved(expected_sequence, tolerance=0.3)

print(f"Accuracy: {validation['accuracy']:.3f}")
print(f"Sequence similarity: {validation['sequence_similarity']:.3f}")
print(f"Timing accuracy: {validation['timing_accuracy']:.3f}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Create detector with custom parameters
detector = SimpleMediaPipeDetector(
    min_detection_confidence=0.7,      # Higher confidence for better accuracy
    min_tracking_confidence=0.7,       # Higher tracking confidence
    movement_threshold=0.015,          # Lower threshold for more sensitive detection
    max_history=20,                    # Keep more movement history
    debug_mode=True                    # Enable debug logging
)

# Use improved validation with custom tolerance
validation = detector.validate_sequence_improved(
    expected_sequence=["left", "right", "up"],
    tolerance=0.5  # More lenient timing tolerance
)
```
